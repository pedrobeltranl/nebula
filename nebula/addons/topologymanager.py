        Generates a fully connected topology where each node is connected to every other node.

        This method creates a fully connected network by generating a Watts-Strogatz graph with the number of nodes set to `n_nodes` and the number of neighbors set to `n_nodes - 1`. The resulting graph is then converted into a numpy matrix and all missing links (i.e., non-ones in the adjacency matrix) are set to 1 to ensure complete connectivity. The diagonal elements are filled with zeros to avoid self-loops.

        Parameters:
            None

        Returns:
            None: The `topology` attribute of the class is updated with the generated fully connected topology.
